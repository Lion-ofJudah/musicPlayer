<body>
    <p>
        PlayMusic is a music player which can play audio files locally. Hopefully in the future, there will be a website
        just like spotify which will be integrated with the local music player. But for now I hope you enjoy it.<br>
        Currently, the application only supports:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>.mod</li>
        <li>.ogg</li>
        <li>.xm</li>
        <li>.mod</li>
        <li>.mp3 (to a smaller extent)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As this is the first version of the application, in the next update, it might be able to support multiple music
        file extensions :). The seek, previous, next, favorites play and playlist play functionalities are also not
        fully implemented.
